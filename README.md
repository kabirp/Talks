Directory Structure:
- Each subfolder is a different talk
- Each subfolder contains its own README that has the YouTube link to the talk
- Each subfolder contains the notes or slides for the talk

My [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kabirpesh) also has all the talks if you prefer to browse there instead.
